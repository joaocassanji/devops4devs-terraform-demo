# Azure Private Endpoint and MSSQL Server Configuration

This Terraform configuration sets up an Azure Private Endpoint for secure access to a SQL Server instance, and also creates the SQL Server and a database within it.

## Resource Definitions

### 1. azurerm_private_endpoint (Private Endpoint)

The `azurerm_private_endpoint` resource creates a private endpoint for secure access to a service within a virtual network.

- **name:** The name of the private endpoint.
- **location:** The Azure region where the private endpoint will be created.
- **resource_group_name:** The resource group in which the private endpoint will be created.
- **subnet_id:** The subnet where the private endpoint will be placed.

The `private_service_connection` block establishes the connection to the service:

- **name:** The name of the private service connection.
- **private_connection_resource_id:** The resource ID of the service to connect to (in this case, the SQL Server).
- **subresource_names:** Specifies the subresource to connect to (e.g., "sqlServer").
- **is_manual_connection:** Indicates whether the connection is manual.

### 2. azurerm_mssql_server (MSSQL Server)

The `azurerm_mssql_server` resource sets up an Azure SQL Server.

- **name:** The name of the SQL Server.
- **location:** The Azure region where the SQL Server will be created.
- **resource_group_name:** The resource group in which the SQL Server will be created.
- **administrator_login:** The login username for the SQL Server administrator.
- **administrator_login_password:** The password for the SQL Server administrator.
- **version:** The version of SQL Server to use (e.g., "12.0").
- **minimum_tls_version:** The minimum TLS version supported by the SQL Server.

### 3. azurerm_mssql_database (MSSQL Database)

The `azurerm_mssql_database` resource creates a database on the SQL Server.

- **name:** The name of the database.
- **server_id:** The ID of the SQL Server on which the database will be created.

## Usage

To use this Terraform module, include it in your Terraform configuration and provide the required variables:

Replace `"./path_to_module"` with the path to your module and adjust the variables as needed for your environment.

This will set up a private endpoint for secure access to your SQL Server, create the SQL Server itself, and provision a database within it.
